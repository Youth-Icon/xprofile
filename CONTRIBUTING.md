# Contributing to [Xprofile](https://github.com/Youth-Icon/xprofile) 💖 

Thank you for considering contributing to this repository! This guide will walk you
through how to do so successfully.

## 🤔 Overview

### 🌍 General guidance

You should
read [GitHub's general guidance on contributing to projects](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)
and [guidance on collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests).

## 🛠️ How to contribute changes

### 🚩 Find or make an issue

Before submitting any changes, document them
in [an issue](https://github.com/Youth-Icon/xprofile/issues/new).
For example, this might be a feature request issue for the feature you will
create or a bug report for the bug you will fix. If the issue already exists,
e.g. a bug report for the same bug you'll fix or a feature request for the same
feature you're building, skip this step. Don't make a duplicate issue.

### 🍴 Forking

To start work on your changes to be
submitted, [fork and clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
this library. You should
then [create a new branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging)
on your fork dedicated to the changes you're making. You should
read [GitHub's docs about branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches).
Make sure you use a separate branch (⇒ PR) for each change (e.g. adding
one feature or fixing one bug) you are making. If you want to make multiple, do
so in separate branches, and submit them in separate PRs. Otherwise, your PRs
will bloat, and it will be hard to review, manage, and keep track of them.


Once you have ensured your changes work as
required, [commit your changes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit)
and [push them to your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository).

Once you've done these, you're ready to submit a Pull Request (PR).

### 🚀 Make a Pull Request

To submit your changes for review and to have them added to this library, you
must make
a [pull request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

Ensure
the [link the issue you made earlier (and any others that are relevant) to your PR](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#manually-linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-the-pull-request-sidebar).

PRs should be made against and merged into
the [`main`](https://github.com/Youth-Icon/xprofile)
branch, which is set as the `default` branch on GitHub.

You can also make
a [draft PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/)
if you need feedback on your changes early on and before
finalizing for merging.

Once you have made a PR, you will then get feedback from the maintainers of the
repo. This will help ensure your changes are ready to be merged.

Happy coding 🚀 🚀
